# Browser-use

## Overview

In this session, we’ll explore the browser-use capabilities of advanced AI models, specifically focusing on how they can access,
retrieve, and interpret up-to-date web data. This session will demonstrate how the integration of browsing functionality enhances 
an AI’s real-time knowledge and expands its ability to answer dynamic queries.

- Objective: Understand the mechanisms that enable AI models to retrieve current, web-based information and process it.
- Evaluation: Test and evaluate the performance of a browser-enabled AI system with expert-level queries that require real-time data retrieval.
- Analysis: Compare the strengths and weaknesses of models that integrate browser-use capabilities versus those that rely solely on pre-trained data.

## Presentation

To refer to this session's presentation, please refer to this [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iEkOpPaggVVBSQxpc7_Igbfh2WzlD15_BBquBjcEsaU/edit?usp=sharing).

We’ll also demonstrate live browsing capabilities, showing how the AI retrieves real-time information from the web and answers advanced queries based on current, publicly available data.

## Usage
